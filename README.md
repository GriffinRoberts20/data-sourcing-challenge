# data-sourcing-challenge
  Here I was practicing sourcing data through API's, in this case the NY Times API and the TMDB API.
My goal was to collect data on NY Time movie reviews that included the word "love" in the headline,
preprocess the data to isolate the title of the movie, then use that to collect and merge in data 
from the TMDB API on the movies I found. I noticed that the NYT's headline's were not consistent,
and was not able to find a fix to be able to correctly isolate every single movie title in this 
manner.
  For the movies I was able to collect on, I merged and further cleaned the data of unnecessary 
clutter, and exported it as a .csv.
